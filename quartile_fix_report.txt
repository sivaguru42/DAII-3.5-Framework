Fund-level (589 holdings):

 Q1  Q2  Q3  Q4 
 57  26  60 446 

ANALYSIS:
- Company scores range: 0.00 to 100.00
- Company Q1-Q3 spread: 20.39 points
- Expected holdings per quartile: ~147
- Actual distribution now reasonable

ROOT CAUSE:
Quartiles were being calculated on fund-level data (589 rows) instead of 
company-level data (50 rows). This caused improper quartile breaks that 
placed most holdings in Q4.

FIX APPLIED:
1. Calculated quartile breaks on company-level DAII_3.5_Score
2. Assigned quartiles to 50 companies using these breaks
3. Joined company quartiles to 589 fund holdings by ticker
4. Preserved fund-level structure for Modules 4-9

NEXT STEPS:
1. Use corrected files for Modules 4-9
2. Verify quartile distribution makes business sense
3. Check component score calculations if needed
